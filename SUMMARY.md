# Summary — Hand Ninja

Quick project summary and developer notes for the Hand Ninja camera hand-tracking game.

Overview
- A Fruit‑Ninja style browser game using MediaPipe Hands.
- Shows full camera feed (user sees themselves) with an overlay for hand landmarks and game objects.
- Slicing is detected using the index-finger tip trail intersecting fruit hitboxes.

Files created
- `index.html` — main page, loads MediaPipe and canvas
- `js/game.js` — game logic, hand-tracking integration, fruit physics
- `README.md` — project overview and run instructions

Task progress
- [x] Decide final feature set (camera hand-tracking game)
- [x] Inspect/create project files (index.html, js/game.js, SUMMARY.md, assets/)
- [x] Integrate MediaPipe Hands camera feed + hand overlay (basic integration completed)
- [ ] Implement fruit spawn, physics, and slicing detection (basic implementation completed in js/game.js; polish remaining)
- [ ] UI: score, lives, start/pause screens, responsiveness (basic UI present)
- [ ] Add sounds, particles, and polish
- [ ] Test on desktop/mobile, optimize performance
- [ ] Deploy and prepare demo README/screenshots

Run locally (quick)
1. Start a local server from the project folder:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
2. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser and allow camera access.
3. Click Start.

Notes / Next steps (3-day plan)
- Day 1: Polish hand tracking responsiveness, tune slice sensitivity, add lives and difficulty progression.
- Day 2: Add sounds, particle effects, fruit splitting visuals, and mobile UI tweaks.
- Day 3: Testing, performance tuning, create demo recording and screenshots, finalize README and deploy.

Implementation caveats
- Uses MediaPipe from CDN; ensure internet access or vendor the models for offline use.
- For best camera performance, test on desktop Chrome/Edge; mobile browsers may require additional tuning.
